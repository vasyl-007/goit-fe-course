      On March 1, the day after the first coronavirus death in the United States
      was announced, brothers Matt and Noah Colvin set out in a silver S.U.V. to
      pick up some hand sanitizer. Driving around Chattanooga, Tenn., they hit a
      Dollar Tree, then a Walmart, a Staples and a Home Depot. At each store,
      they cleaned out the shelves. Over the next three days, Noah Colvin took a
      1,300-mile road trip across Tennessee and into Kentucky, filling a U-Haul
      truck with thousands of bottles of hand sanitizer and thousands of packs
      of antibacterial wipes, mostly from “little hole-in-the-wall dollar stores
      in the backwoods,” his brother said. “The major metro areas were cleaned
      out.” Matt Colvin stayed home near Chattanooga, preparing for pallets of
      even more wipes and sanitizer he had ordered, and starting to list them on
      Amazon. Mr. Colvin said he had posted 300 bottles of hand sanitizer and
      immediately sold them all for between $8 and $70 each, multiples higher
      than what he had bought them for. To him, “it was crazy money.” To many
      others, it was profiteering from a pandemic.
